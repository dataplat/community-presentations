# SQL Community Presentations

This is a centralized repo for SQL Server presentations from the SQL Server Community Collaborative.

Please feel free to add your own presentations and use lower case and use a dash instead of spaces. This follows the format of weblinks.

* author-name\presentation-name.pptx
* author-name\presentation-name-code.zip

Once you have uploaded your presentation, and optionally, code, please update this index in alphabetical order. Use the raw links so that the presentation downloads directly to the browser.
