# SQL Community Presentations

This is a centralized repo for SQL Server presentations from the SQL Server Community Collaborative.

Once you have uploaded your presentation, and optionally, code, please update this index in alphabetical order. Use the raw links so that the presentation downloads directly to the browser.
